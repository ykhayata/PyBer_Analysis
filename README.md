# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of Project 

I have been given the task to analyze the company's ride-share data, using python's pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. The goal is to point out the major differences in data between the three city types; rural, urban, and suburban. As we analyze the data, we are going to examine the different metrics that go into each city type, and how they compare to one another.

## Results 

We are tasked with creating a data frame that measures total rides per city type, total drivers per city type, total fares per city type, average fare per ride, and finally average fare per driver. With this information we came up with a ride-sharing summarry to send to Omar.
