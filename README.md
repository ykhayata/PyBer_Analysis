# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of Project 

I have been given the task to analyze the company's ride-share data, using python's pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. The goal is to point out the major differences in data between the three city types; rural, urban, and suburban. As we analyze the data, we are going to examine the different metrics that go into each city type, and how they compare to one another.
